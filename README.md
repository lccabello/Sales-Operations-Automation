## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. Automated Call Scheduling (Google Apps Script)
**Problem:** Manual data entry from leads sheets to Google Calendar was time-consuming and prone to errors.
**Solution:** Developed a script that parses lead data from Google Sheets, validates date/time formats, and automatically creates calendar events with formatted descriptions.
**Impact:** Reduced scheduling time by approx. 40% and improved follow-up consistency.

### 2. WhatsApp Proposal Generator
**Problem:** Drafting personalized B2B proposals for "Tech Refresh" vs. "Plan Upgrade" manually was inefficient.
**Solution:** Created a script that extracts client data, provides a UI prompt to select the proposal type, and generates a pre-written professional message.
